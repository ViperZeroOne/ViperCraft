==============================================================
ViperCraft Mod for MinecraftForge
==============================================================

Created By: ViperZeroOne

This is my first mod which began simply as a way to learn the
fundamentals of Java while modding Minecraft.  It quickly grew
and became more than I had first intended it to be.  As I
continue to add to this runaway project I hope others will
enjoy the hard work I'm putting into it.

--------------------------------------------------------------
BRANCHES
--------------------------------------------------------------

Master  = Protected branch with tested code that is of either
	  release or release quality.  This code is suspected
          to be relatively bug-free.  All releases compiles will
	  be done using the Master branch.  If you are using a
	  compile (.JAR) from the Master Branch and experience a
	  bug, please report it.
		 
Working = Active branch where all minor updates are pushed to
          and as such the code could contain a lot of bugs.
	  Do not file bug reports on the working branch.
		  
Ver#    = In the event of an upgrade to a new Minecraft version
          the previous Master version of this mod will be archived
	  in a branch named after it's minecraft version. While you
	  can still use these branches for earlier versions of
	  Minecraft, the branches will no longer be updated or 
	  supported once archived.  Do not file bug reports on
	  these archived branches.
