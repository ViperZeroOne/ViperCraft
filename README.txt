==============================================================
ViperCraft Mod for MinecraftForge
==============================================================

Created By: ViperZeroOne

This is my first mod which began simply as a way to learn the
fundimentals of Java while modding Minecraft.  It quickly grew
and became more than I had first intended it to be.  As I
continue to add to this runaway project I hope others will
enjoy the hard work I'm putting into it.
